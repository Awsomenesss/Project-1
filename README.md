* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) (markup language) was used for structuring and presenting content of the website.
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) was used to provide the style to the content written in a HTML.

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to improt icons to the sites.

* [Github](https://github.com/) was used to create the repository and to store the cproject's code after pushed from Git.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the Code Editor for the site

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

I had an error on the index.html page with the iframe attribute of "frameborder". The HTML checker notified me that this attribute is obsolete and to use CSS instead.

I also had an error on the contact_us.html page with a duplicate ID of "form_inline". I rectified this by changing the ID's to a class instead and updated the CSS for this.

I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet.
